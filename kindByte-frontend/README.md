## Tech Stack

Frontend:
* Traditional technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, via Vue are deployed.
* A focus on user experience, convenience, and accessibility
Backend:
* Firebase Auth handles the security and user registration processes.
* Interaction via requests to and responses from Firebase Firestore, such as GET and POST API, to handle user, event and registration data.
Database:
* Firebase Firestore stores user, event and registration data, in a document-based (JSON-like) manner.

## Accomplishments

1. Swift Delivery: We were able to meet the project timelines and schedules. This relieves additional downstream delays in addressing client's needs.
2. Team Synergy and Consistency: Effective teamwork ensured a unified and seamless product experience.

## Key Takeaways

1. Right technology for the right users, and more is not always good. One of our users is beneficiaries, who are Persons With Intellectual Disabilities (PWIDs), with a range of independence, therefore the design and user journey have to consider their experience as well.
2. Client research is vital for requirement analysis, in this case. Diving into their current Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) tools like Google Form will allow vendors (us) to deliver a targeted solution to meet their needs.
